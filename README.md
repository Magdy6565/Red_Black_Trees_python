# Red-Black Tree Implementation in Python
# Introduction
This project is an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in Python. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, where each node stores an extra bit (or property) to determine the color of the node: either red or black. This ensures the tree remains balanced, providing efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and search.

Features
Insertions: Automatically balances the tree after inserting a node.
Deletions: Safely removes nodes while maintaining balance.
Searching: Efficiently searches for values in O(log n) time.
Balancing Rules: Follows red-black tree properties to maintain balance:
Each node is either red or black.
The root is always black.
Red nodes cannot have red children (no two consecutive red nodes).
Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes must have the same number of black nodes.
How it Works
Insertion
The tree balances itself after each insertion by performing rotations and recoloring to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

Deletion
When a node is deleted, the tree rebalances itself by adjusting node colors and performing necessary rotations.

Balancing Mechanism
The balancing process ensures that no path in the tree is disproportionately longer than others, ensuring O(log n) operations for insertion, deletion, and search.
